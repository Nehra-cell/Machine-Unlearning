Overview
In this project, we explored the concept of machine unlearning by implementing neuron masking to selectively unlearn specific classes from a trained model. Using the VGG-16 model and the CIFAR-10 dataset, we successfully unlearned the 'plane' class from the dataset.

Key Components
Model: VGG-16, a convolutional neural network known for its performance in image classification tasks.
Dataset: CIFAR-10, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.
Method: Neuron masking, which involves identifying and deactivating specific neurons associated with the class to be unlearned.
Implementation Details
Training: Initially trained the VGG-16 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset to achieve baseline accuracy.
Neuron Masking: Applied neuron masking techniques to identify and deactivate neurons responsible for recognizing the 'plane' class.
Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance post-unlearning to ensure the 'plane' class was effectively unlearned while retaining accuracy for other classes.
Applications
Machine unlearning is a crucial concept in various domains where the ability to forget specific information is necessary:

Data Privacy: Ensuring compliance with privacy laws by removing sensitive or personal data from trained models.
Security: Mitigating the risk of data poisoning attacks by unlearning compromised or malicious data.
Model Update: Updating models efficiently without the need for complete retraining by selectively unlearning outdated or irrelevant information.
Domain Adaptation: Adapting models to new domains or requirements by unlearning domain-specific biases or irrelevant data
